Since cutaneous paraneoplastic syndromes commonly precede or follow visceral cancer, their recognition may result in earlier diagnosis and better prognosis for the patient (Chart 2).7,8  Curth\u2019s criteria for the diagnosis of cutaneous paraneoplastic syndromes * Treatment of the neoplasia results in regression of the skin lesion; recurrence of the neoplasia implies recurrence of the skin lesion.
